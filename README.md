16th December is observed as a Black Day in Pakistan due to two tragic events in the nation's history:

1. Fall of Dhaka (1971):
On 16th December 1971, East Pakistan became Bangladesh following a war between Pakistan and India. The event marked the disintegration of Pakistan, leaving a deep scar in the country's history. The separation was preceded by political, social, and military tensions between East and West Pakistan.


2. APS Peshawar Attack (2014):
On this day, terrorists attacked the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar, killing 147 people, including 132 children. This brutal attack shocked the nation and is remembered as one of the darkest days in Pakistan's history. It led to significant changes in Pakistan's counter-terrorism strategy, including the implementation of the National Action Plan.



Both events symbolize immense grief for Pakistan, and the day is marked with prayers and remembrance ceremonies.
